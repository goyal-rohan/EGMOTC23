### **Whoa! A webpage for EGMO TC 2023 material!?** 
{: .text-purple}

Yes, indeed! You can find all material, I (Rohan) create for the camp. This is just for the students selected for the Indian team selection and training camp for EGMO 2024. Please do not share it further.

I will make a post here for each of the classes I plan to take and slowly add material i.e. reading and problem sets along with additional references here all the way upto EGMOTC. I will also try to make a "Cool Stuff" post which will contain some miscelleneous things which are not relevant to what we do but are closely related and cool.
