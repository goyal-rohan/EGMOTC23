*page under construction*

The lecture on Pathological problems will be one long session (with breaks) instead of two classes so that you get enough time to think and work through problems you like.

The idea here is sometimes you will not be able to prove as good as bounds as you would like and would only get bad bounds which are far from the expected answer. DON'T BE AFRAID! BE BRAVE! There is a pathological way of actually constructing or doing something matching the bad bounds you have. Often the difficulty for these problems does not come from the bounding or the creativity in the construction but the belief that a construction might exist! The construction itself could be hard too xD.

A certain problem from your IMO TSTs might fit this bill :D
