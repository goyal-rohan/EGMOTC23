*page under construction*

The lecture on Constructions will be one long session (with breaks) instead of two classes so that you get enough time to think and work through problems you like. Constructions in algebra, combinatorics, geometry and number theory all take slightly different form but the underlying ideas remain same. Try to make some observations, what kind of things the structure forces upon you, and so on.

- Some examples and ideas [**Video**]() (*Might take a few days, will be up by 10th December*)
