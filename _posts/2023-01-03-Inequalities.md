We will have one class on inequalities during the EGMOTC. Before class, there will be a problem set with 3-4 problems, and 3 short 20-25 minute videos to watch. I would want you to be used to using AM-GM and Cauchy-Schwarz, induction and some things like telescoping and so on. I will post the solutions of the problem set by 15th December.
