We will have about 2 classes on the Probabilistic Method and some counting techniques. For this, I want you to be familiar with the basics of probability and expectation. For these two classes, I would like you to have read the following 10-12 page document:
{: .text-white}
- **[Main Reading - Intro to Probabilistic Method](/EGMOTC23/pdfs/prob-main-reading.pdf)**
- **[PSet 1]** [**pdf**](/EGMOTC23/pdfs/probabilistic-pset1.pdf)   [**tex**](/EGMOTC23/pdfs/probabilistic-pset1.tex)
- **[PSet 2]** [**pdf**](/EGMOTC23/pdfs/probabilistic-pset2.pdf)   [**tex**](/EGMOTC23/pdfs/probabilistic-pset2.tex)

  
I want you all to try proving the theorems and giving it some thought say 3-5 minutes before moving onto the proof. The important thing is that you familiarize yourself with the technique and it's basic implementations. You are expected to try the problem sets here  and submit before we meet for the respective class (I recommend trying both before the camp). I will also add full solution files before the camp, latest by 15th December. If they are not up by 12th December, send me a reminder just in case I forgot. In class, I will provide you sheets with 1-2 problems which will also have walkthroughs, cases etc. and you all can work through them in groups or individually and I will be there to listen to any ideas or questions you have.

The above material might be a little terse to read (but try to read it first) so I am adding some notes which have a very gentle intro to all the key definitions introduced (The main reading is the first doc only, this is just for help):
{: .text-white}
- [Gentle notes on Probability](/EGMOTC23/pdfs/gentle-intro.pdf)

The following is another option if you find the main reading too terse. You can use any other reference to familiarize yourself with the terms. Googling the words intro to discrete probability should already fetch you some material. A few possible books you can use are:
{: .text-white}
- William Feller's An introduction to probability theory and its applications
- Grimmett and Stirzaker's Probability and Random Processes
- Grimmett and Welsh's Probability: An Introduction (first two chapters).

You should probably be able to find PDFs of these online comfortably with just a google search.
